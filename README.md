# Udacity-capstone-project
 Capstone project applys topics provided throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a real problem by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. 

## Capstone subject
Santander Bank, started in Spain and it has been serving customers in the Northeast since 2013, cares about its customers satisfaction and work to take proactive steps to improve a customer’s happiness before it’s too late . From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around, so Santander Bank posted a competition in Kaggle.com to identify dissatisfied customers.
As an input,  Santander Bank provides hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or not based on their banking experience.
This task is a classification problem since customers should be classified as happy or not.
